# Resources for analyzing and visualizing bench experiments in the informatics space

## Overview

Welcome! This repository is intended for storing code and pointing to external resources for analyzing and/or visualizing experimental data in the life sciences. Examples include:

* Reading genomic and biochemical instrument data files into R
* Genomic data visualization in R with example data sets

We are aiming to provide resources to better translate bench-top results to computer data structures. In particular, we try to bridge the gap in tools that are currently lacking or requires improvement.

In individual scripts, please note relevant references, which may include the names of software packages used/dependent upon and journal articles reporting the software. We thank programmers and developers who have distributed their software packages in advance.

Tutorials may be written in markdown (md) and/or LaTex.

While the programming language is R, it's possible that tools based in other languages such as UNIX, Python, and C may be included in the future.


## Bioinformatics workflows for common bench experiments that are well-documented

* Analysis of flow-cytometry data using the [`flowCore` R/Bioconductor pakcage](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowCore.html)
* Analysis of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in R: [qpcR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qpcR/index.html), [HTqPCR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/HTqPCR.html), [EasyqPCR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EasyqpcR.html)
* Analysis of [dose response curve in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/drc/index.html)

## Coming soon!
 
* Genomic data visualization using the `Gviz` R/Bioconductor package
* Reproducible preparation of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification training data sets in R (original tutorial was in Excel)
