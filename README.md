# Tools4Bioinformatics

Welcome! This repository is intended for storing code/scripts for analyzing and/or visualizing data in the life sciences. Examples include:

* Reading genomic and biochemical instrument data files into R
* Genomic data visualization in R with example data sets

In individual scripts, please note relevant references, which may include the names of software packages used/dependent upon and journal articles reporting the software. We thank programmers and developers who have distributed their software packages in advance.

While the programming language is R, it's possible that tools based in other languages such as UNIX, Python, and C may be included in the future.
